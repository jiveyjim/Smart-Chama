      <h2>How Smart Chama Works</h2>

      <ol class="how-list">
        <li>
          <h4>Join the Chama</h4>
          <p>Register with your full name, phone, email and ID. New members join at the end of the current withdrawal queue.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Daily Contribution</h4>
          <p>Make your daily contribution using M-PESA STK push (or manual deposit) — every payment is recorded in the system.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Withdrawal by Turn</h4>
          <p>Withdraw only on your assigned date/turn. When you withdraw, you are moved to the back of the queue so everyone gets their turn.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Full Transparency</h4>
          <p>Statements show every deposit and withdrawal. Admin announcements and emails keep members informed of meetings and changes.</p>
